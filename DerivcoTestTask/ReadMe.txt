I'm not sure I understood the task correctly. If the solution is wrong, please, let me know, I can fix it.
I didn't know how can I use filters and middleware in this project, because it's quite simple,
therefore I created logger and exception handler. I know that for exception handling there are 
embedded tools.

There was not written in requirements anything about performance and what amount of data would be handled,
therefore I didn't pay attention on performance and choosing best algorithms.

I don't understand what exactly means "Add Postman support from API" and google didn't help me.
Therefore I supposed that you need just exported requests from Postman attached to this project.
If I'm wrong, please let me know.
