# WebAPITestTask
This project is implementation of test task

I didn't know how I could use filters and middleware in this project, because it's quite simple,
therefore I created logger and exception handler. I know that for exception handling there are 
embedded tools.

There was not written in requirements anything about performance and what amount of data would be handled,
therefore I didn't pay attention on performance and choosing best algorithms.
